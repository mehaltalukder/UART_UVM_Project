* This is a project to verify a simple UART design using UVM (Univeral Verification Medothology) and SystemVerilog. 
* To run the simulation using a simulator like Questa just run the "run_uart.do" file in the simulator using the following command
- do run_uart.do
* You can also compile and run the files using any other simulator at edaplayground
